## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in creating a webapp to classify messages given a certain category related humanitarian cirsis.

The dataset given by Figure Eight, acquired in 2019 by [Appen](https://appen.com/), consists of data from almost 26,000 tweets that are related to natural or any disaster and with it I aim to be able to classify future tweets in the corresponding category.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebook available here to showcase work related to the ETL and ML pipelines step-by-step process. Also, you will find all the source code neccesary to deploy locally the app that will be able to classify new messages as well as give you an overview of the data.

If you want to use new or add more data, please use the python programs process_data.py and train_classifier.py.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

A web app is currently on the way to be deployed in the following link, [click here](https://my-disaster-message-classifier.herokuapp.com/) to be redirected.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Appen for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
